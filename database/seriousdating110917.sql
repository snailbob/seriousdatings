However, we do not recognize or respond to any DNT signals as the Internet industry works toward defining exactly what DNT means, what it means to comply with DNT, and a common approach to responding to DNT.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Third-party websites</strong></p>\r\n<p>There are a number of places on our website where you may click on a link to access other websites that do not operate under this Privacy Policy. For example, if you click on an advertisement on our website, you may be taken to a website that we do not control. These third-party websites may independently solicit and collect information, including personal information, from you and, in some instances, provide us with information about your activities on those websites.

	(5, 3, 'Eight Rules for Dating in 2017', '<p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</p><p>Society and its rules fluctuates depending on what people need and what people have. Traditionally, it was menâ€™s sole responsibility to ask women out and pay for the date. Why? Because they had the money, they had the transport and they held all the cards. As the higher-earning gender, along with deciding whom to ask out, they also had the honour of paying for it.</p><p>Society has moved away from this pay model, with women now earning almost as much as men. Nevertheless, this old-fashioned attitude about who should do the asking (and paying) still prevails, creating a disconnect and much confusion. As a Flirtologist, I meet many high-flying, executive women, who make bags of money and have bags of confidence. Why shouldnâ€™t they ask a man out? Besides, men like it!</p><p>So, what are the dating rules in this modern society?</p><div><div><div>- ADVERTISEMENT -</div><div></div></div></div><p>While researching for my book, <em>The Flirt Interpreter</em>, I interviewed 100 men in four different international, Western cities. I asked them if they would like it if a woman approached them and asked them out. The answer was a resounding â€˜yes!â€™ on both counts. Followed by â€˜as long as itâ€™s not done too aggressivelyâ€™. So there we have it - just donâ€™t plop yourself down on their laps, arms dangled around their necks, and expect them to say yes. Other than that, youâ€™ll be fine!</p><p>So, what are the 8 rules for dating in the modern world? I am so glad you asked.</p><p><strong>1. If you like someone, approach them!</strong>&nbsp;Donâ€™t wait for the other person to make the move. Gender has become obsolete in this regard and now itâ€™s more about common sense! How is a guy to know youâ€™re interested if you stand in the corner willing him to walk over? If you are looking at art, for example, and get chatting you could say something like, â€œI have been meaning to go that new exhibition at the V&amp;A. Would you like to join me?â€ Which leads me to rule #2...</p><p><strong>2. Donâ€™t be scared of rejection.</strong>&nbsp;Believe it or not, it is your friend. Statistically, we cannot click with everyone we meet. If you chat to someone and they make it clear that feelings are not reciprocated, move on! Donâ€™t think of it as a setback for your self-esteem, but a step forward to finding someone youâ€™re compatible with.</p><p><strong>3. Keep it casual.</strong>&nbsp;If you see someone cute, walk over and start a natural conversation. Hitting on people can seem intimidating when you think of strutting up and opening with â€œhey, sweet cheeks,â€ but simply asking, â€œis it always this busy? Itâ€™s my first time here,â€ is a casual and natural way to start chatting.</p><p><strong>4. Lower your expectations and do away with false standards.</strong>&nbsp;Despite whatever belief you have in destiny, you will not be able to determine if a man is right for you within two minutes of meeting him. Admit it, you probably spend more time lingering over the Chinese takeaway menu! Once you stop looking at people with, â€œis this the future father of my children?â€ or â€œis she the one?â€ in mind, taking things as they come becomes a lot easier. The question you should be asking is, â€œam I having a good time right now, in this moment?â€</p><p><strong>5. Got a date? Great! Donâ€™t expect the man to pay.</strong>&nbsp;There are a surprising amount of women, even in the younger generations, who expect men to be â€˜chivalrousâ€™ and pay for dates. Why should men pay for dates? We now know that in the past it was because they had more money and had cars, but these days, arenâ€™t we all on equal (or, at least closer) footing? More importantly, donâ€™t we want to be? As a general rule, whoever asks should pay. If women can ask, they can pay and, equally, if men can be asked, they can be taken out!</p><p><strong>6. So youâ€™ve had a great date, wonderful! Now, forget it.</strong>&nbsp;This person youâ€™ve just been on a date with is a stranger minus a few hours youâ€™ve spent together. Get on with your full and happy life and donâ€™t fill your thoughts with romantic ideals of your â€˜futureâ€™. Nobody should keep you waiting by the phone, especially not someone youâ€™ve only just met!</p><p><strong>7. Keep an open mind.</strong>&nbsp;There are plenty more happily ever afters than the old husband, wife, two kids and a white picket fence. Just as we have more choice in the modern world, we also have more scenarios in which we could be happy. Donâ€™t let old-fashioned notions of happiness stop you from actually being happy in life. Which, brings me to rule #8...</p><p><strong>8. You can be happy alone.</strong>&nbsp;You should be happy alone. Why should your feeling of contentedness rest on another human being? Sounds pretty risky to me. Donâ€™t wait for someone else to come along and fill in the gaps. Start living your life and now! People are attracted to happy people. Be open, be happy, exude that happiness and the person to share that with will be drawn to you.</p><p>The rules have certainly changed in the last few generations of flirting history. Women can approach, men donâ€™t have to pay for dates and being single is coveted rather than pitied. Nowadays, we have the capacity to flirt and date for fun, not just for the traditional goal of an early marriage. We have the tools at our disposal to enjoy single life, no matter what gender we are. The â€˜rulesâ€™ are about <em>you</em>&nbsp;and <em>your</em>life, rather than finding someone to complete your life.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p></p>', '956973_ozamiDatingBlog.jpg', 'Suntech', '2017-09-15 02:40:11', 'Publish'),
	(6, 1, 'Why I Wonâ€™t Date Guys Who Lol', '<p>\r\n\r\n</p><p>When it comes to dating I donâ€™t discriminate. Iâ€™ve never had a â€˜typeâ€™ - a concept Iâ€™ve never really understood - or a mental checklist detailing prerequisites that potential candidates must tick off before I grant them the honour of my company. Thatâ€™s right: job, background, creed, whether they shop at Sports Direct or American Apparel - itâ€™s no odds to me. As long as Iâ€™ve got a connection with a person, they make me laugh and well, you know, I fancy them, then itâ€™s all go. I do, however, have one absolute deal-breaker - something which has the potential to turn me off a man like wildfire - I canâ€™t date a guy with bad grammar and I could never, ever, date someone who says lol.</p><p>Yes. I would rather a man with a bad lisp, two lazy eyes or one who wore proper shoes with jeans than a loller. I am fully aware that this might sound snobby, petty, maybe even arrogant, but I believe that textspeak is slowly but surely permeating our speech, reducing our language and turning us into a generation of â€˜emotionally incontinent mawksâ€™, as Janice Turner of the Times put it.</p><p>Lol (laughing out loud for the uninitiated) made it into the OED (duh?! the Oxford English Dictionary) in 2011 as an â€˜initialismâ€™, an abbreviation consisting of the initial letters of a name or expression. Similar gems included tmi (too much information), imho (in my humble opinion - who knew?) and, perhaps the most heinous of them all, yolo (you only live once). While I accept such acronyms as the inevitable consequence of the spread of digital communication and social media, I refuse to accept that they are replacing words or, worse still, human emotions.</p><div><div><div>- ADVERTISEMENT -</div><div></div></div></div><p>To my mind, lol is at best mildly irritating, at worst lazy, disingenuous and just plain dumb. The sight of it triggers the same wave of nausea I get when I hear the Go Compare jingle or when someone updates their Facebook status with â€˜.comâ€™ (â€˜tired.com!!â€™) or invents a cringworthy, generic hashtag to end a statement on Twitter - hard to articulate but strong enough to churn my stomach and make me despair in humanity. Hereâ€™s a classic example from an exchange I recently witnessed on twitter:</p><p>Girl: â€˜OMG. Boys are SO frustrating # Girl Problems *angry emoticon*</p><p>Boy: why are we frustrating lol *winky emoticon*</p><p>This kind of â€˜conversationâ€™ both baffles and depresses me. â€˜Where is the punctuation?â€™ my brain screams â€˜Why is there a lol just hanging there at the end of the sentence like some useless appendage?â€™ â€˜Whatâ€™s the point of the emoticons? â€˜What does it all MEAN? So when a message from a potential date appears in my inbox saying, â€˜Sunday morning howâ€™s the hangover lolâ€™, well letâ€™s just say the potential is lost.</p><p>As a means of expression lol is incredibly reductive. Put it this way, what did people say before lol (and for that matter emojis) existed? Hard to remember I know but my guess is real words or - GASP - actual sentences? I fail to see how a multi-layered concept like humour spanning irony, sarcasm, satire, parody, slapstick, bathos and pathos too, got bundled up and re-packaged into three meaningless letters? Itâ€™s synthetic emotion: faceless, generic, immature and just makes me feel like Iâ€™m talking to a hollographic image of the 21st century instead of a real life individual.</p><p>Another problem with lolâ€™s ambiguity is its tendency to mask emotions. Lols at the end of messages while dating can be particularly perplexing: â€˜Youâ€™re crazy - just kidding lolâ€™, â€˜Of course I want to meet your parents lolâ€™, and have you ever noticed how some people use lol as a way to mitigate a potentially devastating message or status update? â€˜Single on a Saturday night for the first time in 8 years...oh well, looks like itâ€™s takeaway tonight lolâ€™.</p><p>Besides all of which, have you ever noticed that the very reason a person has said they are â€˜LMAOâ€™ (laughing my arse off) or even LMFAO (you guessed it - laughing my f***ing arse off) is invariably not even remotely funny? Strange that.</p><p>Most disturbing of all, this teeny-tech-robotron language is rapidly infiltrating peoplesâ€™ actual speech. An entire generation are growing up thinking that this is the norm, that this is the way weâ€™ve always spoken. Am I the only one who has silently despaired on a bus journey as a group of teenagers proudly and defiantly scream nonsensical words at each other which neither we, nor probably even they, mutually understand? I canâ€™t help but feel that by dumbing down our language we are inevitably dumbing down ourselves. We produced Shakespeare and Oscar Wilde, we have the richest vocabulary in the entire world, and what do we type inanely to each other behind our plastic screens? â€˜Ha ha. Lol.â€™</p>\r\n\r\n<br><p></p>', '308154_Beautiful-stylish-girl-goggles-wear.jpg', 'Suntech', '2017-09-15 04:06:45', 'Publish'),
